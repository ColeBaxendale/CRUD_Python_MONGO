# CRUD_Python_MONGO

## MOTIVATION
The motivation behind this project is to create a CRUD Python module that serves the purpose of performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB. 

The project's primary goal is to develop an interactive dashboard using Dash, a Python web application framework. The dashboard connects to a MongoDB database through an AnimalShelter class and loads the data into a Pandas Data Frame. The dashboard's layout includes a title with a logo and a unique identifier, interactive filtering options for selecting rescue types, a data table for displaying animal data with sorting and pagination, a pie chart showing breed percentages based on the chosen filter, and a geo-location chart pinpointing the location of selected animals. Users can select from three rescue types or choose the "Reset" option to reset the dashboard to its initial state. Additionally, the dashboard offers interactive features like clicking on data table rows to view animal locations and clicking on the logo to open a specified URL. The project focuses on data visualization and customization, while some warning messages related to Plotly Express and Pandas are present but do not impact the dashboard's functionality.

The project leverages a combination of powerful tools to deliver its essential functionality. MongoDB serves as the model component, offering a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution that accommodates semi-structured animal shelter data. The integration with Python through PyMongo for data retrieval and manipulation. Dash, a web framework developed by Plotly, forms the backbone of the web application, enabling the creation of interactive data visualization dashboards. It utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, Plotly Express, and Dash-Leaflet to craft dynamic interfaces. Pandas plays a pivotal role in data manipulation and transformation, while Plotly Express simplifies the generation of engaging charts and graphs. Dash-Leaflet enhances the application with interactive maps. JupyterDash facilitates the development and testing of Dash applications within the Jupyter environment. Base64 encoding is employed to embed images, such as logos, directly into the HTML structure. These tool choices were made for their compatibility, versatility, and capacity to streamline the development process, resulting in a robust and user-friendly animal shelter dashboard.

The completion of the animal shelter dashboard project involved several essential steps and the effective utilization of various technologies. Initially, data was extracted from a MongoDB database using PyMongo, and the retrieved data was structured into a Pandas DataFrame. The Dash framework played a pivotal role in designing the dashboard's layout, which included a title, logo, interactive filtering options, a data table, and visualizations such as a pie chart and geographic map. Interactive filtering allowed users to select specific rescue types, dynamically updating the displayed data. Challenges during development, such as the display of the pie chart and map side by side and refining the "Reset" filter functionality, were overcome through iterative development and collaboration. The final deployment enabled access to the dashboard via a local server, providing an intuitive and informative tool for analyzing animal shelter data.
